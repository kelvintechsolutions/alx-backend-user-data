Basic Authentication API
Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing Basic Authentication for a simple API. The purpose is to understand the authentication process and implement it manually for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, itâ€™s advisable to use established modules or frameworks (e.g., Flask-HTTPAuth in Python-Flask) for such tasks.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

What authentication means
What Base64 is and how to encode a string in Base64
What Basic authentication means
How to send the Authorization header in an HTTP request
Requirements
Python Scripts:
Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7
Files must end with a new line
The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/env python3
Follow the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)
All files must be executable
Use wc to test the length of files
All modules, classes, and functions must have proper documentation
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alx-backend-user-data.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd alx-backend-user-data/0x01-Basic_authentication
Install dependencies:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Start the server:

API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
Use the API:

curl "http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status"
Tasks
Simple-basic-API

Implement a simple API with Basic Authentication.
Setup and test the API as described in the project requirements.
Error Handler: Unauthorized

Add an error handler for HTTP status code 401.
Implement a route to test this error handler.
Error Handler: Forbidden

Add an error handler for HTTP status code 403.
Implement a route to test this error handler.
Auth Class

Create an Auth class with methods to handle authentication-related tasks.
Define Non-Authenticated Routes

Update the require_auth method to manage paths that don't need authentication.
Request Validation

Validate requests by checking for the Authorization header and handle errors.
Basic Auth Class

Create a BasicAuth class inheriting from Auth.
Base64 Encoding/Decoding

Implement methods to handle Base64 encoding and decoding in the BasicAuth class.
